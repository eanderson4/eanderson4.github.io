<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Here are the wholesale prices for utilitiy Madison Gas and Electric.  The prices on the grid are decided by an independent entity know as Midwest Independent Systems Operators (MISO).  They clear the market for bulk electricity in two stages, a day-ahead market and a real-time market.  The real-time market is on a rolling 5 minute basis, so every 5 minutes they have to clear a market which involves finance calculations and more differently power flow equations.  The day-ahead market is difficult as well and is more about strategic decisions for the future uncertain demand.

    <h3>Interesting Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The period before the recession (2006 - mid 2008) has much higher volatility than the following period (mid 2008 - 2014)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>One possible explanation is a change in the generation portfolio.  The prices never recover after the recession, however (I have yet to check) the demand most likely recovers so the lower prices are most likely due to lower natural gas prices.  This lowers the cost of generators with ramping capability which makes peak times relatively less costly. </li>
    <li>To investigate, need total demand data as well as generator mix data</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The first quarter of 2014 has large price spikes, which follow a period of relatively low volatility</li>
  <ul>
    <li>What happened? Long term generator outages? Unplanned shut down of plants? Long term line outages? Unplanned loss of lines? Wholesale fuel prices? </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Using the yearly rolling averages, it can be seen that the residential rates are consistently climbing while wholesale prices have fallen and stayed low over the same period</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Is there an explanation for this?  Renewable targets? Building new generators? Infrastructure development? </li>
    <li>Here is <a href="http://www.mge.com/about-mge/electricity/elec-from.htm">MGE's current sourcing</a> for electricity</li>
    <ul>
      <li>As such, since only around 1/4 of it is purchased electricity, its average weighted cost of electricity will only be partially affected by the wholesale prices of electricity.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
  
    <h3>Graph Explanation</h3>
<p>
    This graph displays the time-series prices for the day-ahead and real-time prices for Madison Gas & Electric.  These are the prices determined by an optimization routine done by the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) in order to determine a least cost supply of power to meet demand and maintain given reliability standards.  The day-ahead prices are determined, you got it, a day in advance.  The generators submit there bid offers and the demand is estimated using a forecasting procedure.  The <b>day-ahead problem</b> has two complicating elements and determines hourly prices for the following day.  First, MISO needs to determine which generators to have online throughout the next day.  Second, they need to ensure they are N-1 secure in order to meet requirements set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commision (FERC).  N-1 secure means that the power grid is capable of withstanding any one power line or generator going down and not disrupting load.  They must also be able to move to an operating point in which no lines are overloaded within a given time frame.  Since the day-ahead problem is scheduled to forecast, the <b>real-time problem</b> must make up for errors in forecast as well as unforeseen events such as a power line or generator outage.  This is done on a 5 minute basis, that is, every 5 minutes the new supply offers are cleared with the realized real-time demand.
</p>
<p>
Each day is represented by its average price for both the real-time and day-ahead prices.  The region between the maximum price and the minimum price for any day is shaded to represent the prices it took on any given day.

<h3>MISO Data</h3>
<p>
  If your interested in this data, surely check out the <a href="https://www.misoenergy.org/LMPContourMap/MISO_All.html">real time prices</a> provided by MISO.  They have loads of publically available data through their <a href="https://www.misoenergy.org">site</a>, just navigate to their market reports for data or have a look around to see how the power grid is operated.  
</p>

<h3>Graphing Toolkit</h3>
<p>
The data was pulled from MISO's website and loaded into a sqlite3 database.  The database is pushed to a csv file that <a href="http://dygraphs.com/"> dygraphs </a> can read.  Great examples were provided to easily add the needed options to get a beautiful display.
